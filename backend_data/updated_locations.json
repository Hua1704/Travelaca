Son Tra is put under the national protected forest regulation since it is a natural preservation area. The Peninsula is famous for its plentiful plants and fauna as well as the attractive scenery. It is said that fairies used to come here for singing, dancing and playing chess so Son Tra is also called Tien Sa (Fairies\u2019 landing place).\nOn Son Tra, there still remain more than 30km\u00b2 of natural forests, nearly 300 types of plants and several hundred kinds of fauna, including rare animal. From the top of the mountain, you can see the overall view of Danang City, Marble Mountains, Ba Na \u2013 Mount Chua, so interesting!\nThere is also Suoi Da (Stone Stream), which lies by the side of the foot of the mountain, fine sandy surfaces run round the peninsula, several breaks of waves are running steadily up and down and washing up on the stones heaped up around the seaside.\nAll are attractive spots for tourists. It is so majestic, so romantic, so wide and really beautiful.",

The Cu Chi Tunnels network was built within 25 years from 1948 during the war against the French. It served as a means of communication between villages and helped the Vietnamese to evade scouting French soldiers.\nThe tunnel network was extended over an area of 250 kilometers during the Vietnam War. Therefore, it became one of the important parts of Viet Cong fighting troops\u2019 strategy and also the home for thousands of soldiers.",
